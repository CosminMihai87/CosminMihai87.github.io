# About Me
I am an explorer, i have tried a little bit of everything in the past 2 decades from Pascal, Assembly, C++, C#, .NET, Unity to Javascript, TypeScript, Angular, React, Web development, mySql, MongoDB, Shell/Bash scripts, etc. Some of these in educational context and some as personal projects/development/testing. I like coffee and a good coding challenge and I genuinely think that everything is possible and that 'there is always a way'. This makes me an ambitious person, determined and to some degree stubborn to find solutions and get the job done.

Right now i am interested mostly in Front-end development with React.

One of my passions are computer games, not so much in playing then as used to... but now I'm interested in working on a game, maybe a small part of it or it's engine and design. I try to stay up to date with the latest Game Development Industry, News and Technologies.
